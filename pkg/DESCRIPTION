Description: This package makes it possible to create Java objects and to execute methods. 
    The Java environment is handled by a gateway server. Commands are sent to the server 
    from the R environment through a socket connection. In order to compensate for the low  
    performance of socket connections, the package implements  the concept of vector in the 
    calls to Java methods. More information is available at
