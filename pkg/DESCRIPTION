Title: Create Java Objects and Execute Java Methods
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mathieu Fortin
Maintainer: Mathieu Fortin <mathieu.fortin.re@gmail.com>
Description: Makes it possible to create Java objects and to execute Java methods from the R environment. 
    The Java Virtual Machine is handled by a gateway server. Commands are sent to the server 
    through a socket connection from the R environment. Calls to Java methods allow for 
    vectors so that a particular method is iteratively run on each element of the vector. A 
    score algorithm also makes the calls to Java methods less restrictive.
